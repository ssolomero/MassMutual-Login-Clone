# Description
This is a front end clone of Mass Mutual's Retirement Access login and register page. They recently changed the login page, but the register page should still look similar to mine (https://myaccount.massmutual.com/register-online?flowType=register-online). 

I decided to clone this becuase I enjoyed the user experience of the register page. Their form uses natural language like, "My name is _ and I was born on _." In a previous version, their inputs would be highlighted yellow when selected, but they no longer have that feature. I thought it gave a cool aesthetic and contrasted well with their dark blue header bar. 

# Tools
The main tools I tried to utilize were CSS Grid and Sass. 

# TODO
- Floating label animation 
- Simple backend to keep track of users 
- Password and SSN view toggle
